                                    <h3>What is a Video Intercom System?</h3>
                                    <p>A video intercom system is an advanced communication and security tool that
                                        allows you to see, hear, and speak with visitors before granting access to your
                                        premises. Typically used in schools, hospitals, and other secure facilities,
                                        these systems enhance safety by enabling staff to monitor and control entry
                                        points from a central location or multiple locations. Video intercoms integrate
                                        video surveillance with audio communication, allowing for real-time interaction
                                        and decision-making. Whether you need to manage visitor access, improve internal
                                        communication, or monitor sensitive areas, a video intercom system provides an
                                        effective and reliable solution.</p>
